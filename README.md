# MSQ-Index (Multi Succinct Q-gram Tree Index)

## What is it?
MSQ-Index is a succinct index for fast graph similarity search.It can efficiently answer the following query problem: Given a graph database ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{5+4+(2-3-(6+\frac{4}{5}))}{3(6-2)(2-7)})

$G =\{g_1 ,g_2, \dots, g_n\}$, a query graph $h$ and an edit distance threshold $\tau$, find the graphs in $G$ are similar to $h$; that is, $Cand = \{g: g \in G \ and \ ged(g, h) \leq \tau\}$, where $ged(g, h)$ is the edit distance between $g$ and $h$.
	 
## How to use it?
   MSQ-Index consists of two components, index building and query processing. You should build the MSQ-Index on the graph databased $G$, then perform the query processing. 
### Step I. Install
   1. download (or clone) the source code from https://github.com/Hongweihuo-Lab/MSQ-Index/
   2. Compile the source code. 
### Step II. Build MSQ-Index 
   1. run the shell command: "./multiBuild db db_num pos l", where *db* is the graph database, *db_num* is the number of graphs to be built, *pos* is the index position(e.g., ./index/), and *l* is the subreiogn length. 
### Step III. Query 
   1. run the shell command: "./multiQuery pos query_db threshold", where *pos* is the index position, *query_db* is the query graph sets, *threshold* is the edit distance threshold $\tau$.
